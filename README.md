This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python, Flask, HTML, and JavaScript.
Requirements

    Python 3
    Flask

How to Run

How to Play

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake. The objective of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or your own body. Each time the snake eats an apple, its length increases and the score is updated.
Limits of the Code

    The snake moves at a fixed speed, making it difficult to control at high scores.
    The game does not have any sound effects or music.
    The game does not have any pause or restart features.

To Improve

    Add different difficulty levels or a progressive difficulty system to make the game more challenging.
    Implement a high score leaderboard to keep track of the top players.
    Add sound effects or music to enhance the gaming experience.
    Implement pause and restart features to make the game more user-friendly.
